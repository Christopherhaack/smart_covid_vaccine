# smart_covid_vaccine
this repository is meant to be a public repository with information around how best to distribute a vaccine in the USA upon release. It allows as a variable the number of vaccines currently available and the amount already given out to determine where to give vaccines next. Specifically we believe we can save lives by identifying the most at risk areas and getting vaccines to there first.


## Datasources

We have compiled the following datasources to get information. Some datasources we have preprocessed to make life easier. 
Data will be disaggregated at the US county level.

### publicly available:

covid stastics from Johns hopkins et al. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
US census data taken from ACS 5 year 2014-18 estimates at the county level DP5: 
  https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSDP1Y2019.DP05&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true
Economic data taken from CBP (specifically looking for medical industries): 

### Wishlist

We would love to use google places api to get access to location of number of hospitals/schools/grocery_stores to better understand spread locations.
